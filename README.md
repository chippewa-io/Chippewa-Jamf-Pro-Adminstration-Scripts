## Introduction

Managing Apple devices in an enterprise environment can be complex. To simplify and automate tasks, We've created a set of scripts tailored for use with Jamf Pro. While we maintain a collection of private, proprietary scripts, this repository is dedicated to sharing those that we believe can benefit the broader community.

## Scripts Included

Here you'll find a variety of scripts, each designed to address specific needs within Jamf Pro. This is an example of what you might find:

- **ConnectPreferenceFileCheck.sh**

More scripts will be added over time, so be sure to check back for updates!

## Installation

Some scripts may require specific dependencies or configurations. Be sure to review the prerequisites listed in each script. Common requirements might include:

- Bash shell
- Curl
- jq
- Access to Jamf Pro API
